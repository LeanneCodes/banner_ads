# Banner Ads Collection
This project is a demonstration of how I take static Photoshop (PSD) designs and, using my front-end development skills, convert them into fully functional HTML5 display banner ads. These ads are designed to meet web standards and are deployed at scale via platforms like Google Ads (CM360).

I have worked on campaigns for multiple clients across various industries, and this project includes a live carousel showcasing some of the brands I’ve created banners for. It reflects both my attention to detail and ability to transform design briefs into polished, performant ad creatives.
